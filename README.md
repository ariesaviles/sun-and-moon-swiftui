Sun and Moon is an iOS app that adapts to the user's light/dark mode device settings. While the device has Dark Mode off, the interface of the app displays information about the sun in Athens, GA. The slider in the middle of the screen moves the sun and displays the time at which the sun is rising or setting. While the decide has Dark Mode on, the interface displays the moon. As the user moves the slider with Dark Mode enabled, the app displays facts about each phase of the moon.
